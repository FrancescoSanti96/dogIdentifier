# Experiments Directory

This directory contains experimental code and analysis for the Dog Breed Classifier project.

## Structure

### `enhanced_vs_baseline/`
Complete experimental comparison between enhanced training techniques and baseline approach for Australian Shepherd recognition.

**Status**: Completed âœ…  
**Decision**: Baseline approach selected  
**Key Finding**: Baseline achieved 60.9% Australian Shepherd accuracy vs Enhanced 43.5%

See the [detailed README](enhanced_vs_baseline/README.md) for complete experiment documentation.

## Guidelines for New Experiments

When adding new experiments:

1. **Create a dedicated subdirectory** for each major experiment
2. **Include a README.md** explaining the experiment's purpose and results
3. **Preserve all experimental code** even after completion
4. **Use relative paths** to maintain project structure independence
5. **Document decisions and rationale** for future reference

## Project Organization

Experimental files are moved here to:
- Keep the main project directory clean
- Preserve valuable experimental work
- Maintain organized development history
- Enable easy reference for future decisions

This follows the principle of preserving experimental context while maintaining a clean production codebase.
