# Enhanced vs Baseline Training Experiment

This directory contains the experimental scripts used to compare enhanced training approaches against the baseline training method for dog breed classification, with a specific focus on Australian Shepherd recognition.

## Experiment Overview

**Objective**: Test whether advanced training techniques can improve Australian Shepherd recognition accuracy compared to baseline approach.

**Result**: Baseline approach proved superior for Australian Shepherd recognition (60.9% vs 43.5%).

**Decision**: Proceed with baseline training for full-scale 120-breed classification.

## Files Description

### Core Experimental Scripts

- **`quick_train_enhanced.py`** - Enhanced training script with advanced techniques:
  - Albumentations data augmentation
  - AdamW optimizer with weight decay
  - Label smoothing (0.1)
  - Increased dropout (0.5)
  - CosineAnnealingLR scheduler
  - Gradient clipping

- **`dataloader_enhanced.py`** - Advanced data augmentation pipeline using Albumentations:
  - Geometric transformations (rotation, shift, scale)
  - Color augmentations (brightness, contrast, saturation)
  - Noise injection and cutout
  - More sophisticated augmentation than standard PyTorch transforms

- **`test_enhanced_model.py`** - Comprehensive testing script for enhanced model:
  - Australian Shepherd specific evaluation
  - Full dataset testing (all 5 breeds)
  - Detailed error analysis and comparison with baseline

### Analysis and Comparison Scripts

- **`quick_comparison.py`** - Rapid comparison script between baseline and enhanced:
  - Side-by-side training and evaluation
  - Performance metrics comparison
  - Quick validation of approaches

- **`analyze_enhanced_results.py`** - Detailed analysis of enhanced vs baseline results:
  - Comprehensive metrics comparison
  - Training behavior analysis
  - Technical recommendations

  - Recommendations for future work

## Key Results Summary

### Australian Shepherd Recognition Accuracy
- **Baseline Model**: 60.9% (comprehensive test) / 63.6% (focused test)
- **Enhanced Model**: 43.5%
- **Winner**: Baseline approach

### Overall Test Accuracy (5 breeds)
- **Baseline Model**: 66.2%
- **Enhanced Model**: 56.8%
- **Winner**: Baseline approach

### Key Insights
1. Enhanced approach may have been over-regularized for the dataset size
2. Baseline approach better suited for specific breed focus (Australian Shepherd)
3. Advanced augmentation didn't improve target breed recognition
4. Simpler approach proved more effective for this specific objective

## Usage

All scripts are configured to run from this directory with correct relative paths to the main project structure:

```bash
# From experiments/enhanced_vs_baseline/
python quick_train_enhanced.py      # Train enhanced model
python test_enhanced_model.py       # Test enhanced model
python quick_comparison.py          # Compare both approaches
python analyze_enhanced_results.py  # Detailed analysis
python final_recommendation.py      # Final decision summary
```

## Dependencies

These scripts use the main project's dependencies plus:
- `albumentations` - Advanced data augmentation
- Standard PyTorch/torchvision stack

## Experiment Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - Enhanced vs baseline comparison finished
✅ **DECISION MADE** - Baseline approach selected for full training
✅ **DOCUMENTED** - All results and rationale preserved

This experiment validated the pilot testing approach before committing to full-scale training on 120 dog breeds.
